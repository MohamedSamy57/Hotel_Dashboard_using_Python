## Project Overview

This repository showcases an analytical dashboard developed to evaluate hotel performance using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. The dashboard is designed to provide clear and actionable insights into hotel operations, helping to make informed decisions about pricing, occupancy, and service quality.

## Key Features

- **Room Rate Analysis**: Provides a graphical representation of average room rates across three different hotels, allowing for the analysis of pricing differences and competitiveness.

- **Price Comparison**: Includes a pie chart that visualizes the ratio of room rates among different hotels, offering a comprehensive view of competitive pricing.

- **Room Occupancy Analysis**: Features a chart that displays occupancy rates by room type (e.g., family, single, deluxe), helping to identify the most popular and frequently booked room types.

- **Room Rating Analysis**: Displays average room ratings by type in a graphical format, contributing to the assessment of service quality and customer satisfaction.

## Visualizations

The dashboard provides the following visualizations:
- **Graphs and Charts**: Illustrate key performance metrics and comparisons.
- **Pie Charts**: Show proportional data for quick and easy interpretation.
- **Bar Charts**: Compare different categories and highlight trends.

## Purpose

The dashboard is intended to assist hotels in:
- **Improving Pricing Strategies**: By understanding competitive rates and pricing trends.
- **Increasing Occupancy**: By identifying popular room types and optimizing availability.
- **Enhancing Service Quality**: By evaluating room ratings and customer feedback.

## Data and Analysis

The dashboard relies on accurate and structured data to deliver meaningful insights. Data preparation and cleaning are essential steps to ensure the reliability of the analyses and visualizations.
